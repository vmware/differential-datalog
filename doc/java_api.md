# DDlog Java API

This document describes the steps required to invoke a DDlog program from Java,
based on the `test/datalog_tests/redist.dl` example DDlog program and Java code
in `java/test_flatbuf`.

## Prerequisites

See the [README](https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog#prerequisites)
for instructions on how to install the Google FlatBuffers library required to 
compile DDlog Java bindings.

## Compile DDlog Java bindings

Skip this step if you are using a binary release of DDlog, where pre-compiled
Java bindings can be found in `java/ddlogapi.jar`.  To compile them from
source:

```
cd java
make
```

## Compiling DDlog programs with Java API enabled

Pass the `-j` switch to the DDlog compiler to generate Rust and Java code
required to communicate with the DDlog program from Java.  When compiling the
resulting Java program, enable the `flatbuf` feature:

```
ddlog -i test/datalog_tests/redist.dl -L lib -j
cd test/datalog_tests/redist_ddlog
cargo build --features=flatbuf --release
```

Link the compiled DDlog program along with the DDlog Java API bindings in a
single dynamic library.  Assuming the `$DDLOG` environment variable points to
the directory where DDlog is installed:

```
cc -shared -fPIC -I${JAVA_HOME}/include -I${JAVA_HOME}/include/${JDK_OS} -I. -I${DDLOG}/lib ${DDLOG}/java/ddlogapi.c -Ltarget/release/ -lredist_ddlog -o libddlogapi.so
```

(on a Mac, use the `.dylib` extension instead of `.so`).

## Linking against DDlog API

Finally, add the following dependencies to your Java project to be able to use
the DDlog API:

- The generic DDlog Java API shared by all DDlog programs in the `ddlogapi.jar`
  package (see above).

- The FlatBuffers Java runtime library, found in the `java` directory of the
  FlatBuffers distro.

- The auto-generated `ddlog` package that contains program-specific bindings
  needed to serialize and de-serialize data exchanged by Java and DDlog.  It is
  found in he `flatbuf/java` directory inside the generated
  `<progname>_ddlog` source tree.

## Using the DDlog API from Java

Here is a minimal Java program, copied from `java/test_flatbuf/Test.java` that
instantiates and uses the DDlog API.

```
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.RuntimeException;

/* Generic DDlog API shared by all programs. */
import ddlogapi.DDlogException;
import ddlogapi.DDlogAPI;
import ddlogapi.DDlogCommand;

/* Additional program-specific bindings generated by `ddlog`. */
import ddlog.redist.*;

public class Test {
    private final DDlogAPI api;

    Test() throws DDlogException, IOException {
        /* Create an instance of the DDlog program with one worker thread. */
        this.api = new DDlogAPI(1, null, false);
        api.recordCommands("replay.dat", false);
    }

    void onCommit(DDlogCommand<Object> command) {
        int relid = command.relid();
        switch (relid) {
            case redistRelation.Span:
                SpanReader span = (SpanReader)command.value();
                System.out.println("From " + relid + " " + command.kind() + " Span{" + span.entity() + "," + span.tns() + "}");
                break;
            default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown relation id " + relid);
        }
    }

    void run() throws DDlogException {

        /* First transaction */
        {
            /* Start transaction.  All DDlog table updates must be made in the
             * context of a transaction. */
            this.api.transactionStart();

            /* Create a builder object that will be used to serialize DDlog commands
             * into a buffer. */
            redistUpdateBuilder builder = new redistUpdateBuilder();

            /* Create several DDlog commands.  Commands are stored inside the
             * builder. */
            builder.insert_DdlogNode(10000);
            builder.insert_DdlogBinding((short)100, 10000);
            builder.insert_DdlogDependency(10000, 20000);

            /* Apply commands serialized by the builder to the DDlog program. */
            builder.applyUpdates(this.api);

            /* Commit transaction, triggering the `onCommit` callback for every
             * record in an output relation modified by the transaction. */
            redistUpdateParser.transactionCommitDumpChanges(this.api, r -> this.onCommit(r));
        }

        /* Second transaction */
        {
            this.api.transactionStart();
            /* each applyUpdates requires its own builder */
            redistUpdateBuilder builder = new redistUpdateBuilder();
            builder.insert_DdlogNode(20000);
            builder.insert_DdlogBinding((short)200, 20000);
            builder.delete_DdlogNode(10000);

            builder.applyUpdates(this.api);

            redistUpdateParser.transactionCommitDumpChanges(this.api, r -> this.onCommit(r));
            this.api.stop();
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, DDlogException {
        Test test = new Test();
        test.run();
    }
}
```

To run the program:
```
java -Djava.library.path=. Test > test.dump
```

Note the use of the `-D` switch to tell Java where to look for the `libddlogapi.so`
dynamic library.

This program uses two Java packages to interact with the DDlog program.  The
first one is the `ddlogapi` package, which exports Java wrappers around all
DDlog C API methods in `rust/template/ddlog.h`.  The source code of this
package can be found in the `java/ddlogapi` directory.
While in principle complete, this API is not particularly ergonomic when working
with DDlog values (see below).  In order to facilitate programmer-friendly,
type-safe manipulation of input and output records, the DDlog compiler, when
invoked with `-j` flag, generates an additional Java package specialized to each
particular DDlog program.  The package is called `ddlog.<prog_name>`
(`ddlog.redist` in the above example) and can be found in the
`<prog_name>_ddlog/flatbuf/java/redist` directory.  Below, we discuss both
packages in more detail.

### The `ddlogapi` package

#### `class DDlogAPI`

An instance of the `DDlogAPI` class represents a running DDlog program.  The
`DDlogAPI` constructor starts the program.  `DDlogAPI` public methods are
wrappers around C API functions declared in `ddlog.h` and have the same names,
formatted in camel case instead of snake case, e.g.:

- `stop` - terminate the DDlog program
- `transactionStart` - start a transaction
- `applyUpdates` - apply updates to output tables
- `transactionCommit` - commit the transaction
- `dumpTable` - dump the content of an output relation

Most `DDlogAPI` methods throw an instance of `DDlogException`, containing an
error message from DDlog.  In addition, methods that work with files, e.g.,
`recordCommands`, are declared with `throws IOException`.

#### `class DDlogCommand`

The `DDlogCommand<T>` class represents an update to a DDlog relation, i.e., an
insertion, or deletion of a record (record modifications are currently not
supported through the Java API).  To perform a set of updates to input
relations, the client creates an array of `DDlogCommand`'s and passes it to the
`DDlogAPI.applyUpdates()` method.  Dually, when the client commits a transaction
by calling `DDlogAPI.commitDumpChanges()`, they get back zero or more
`DDlogCommand`'s, which represent changes to output relations.

The `DDlogCommand<T>` class is parameterized with a class that represents DDlog
records.  One such class, defined in the `ddlogapi` package, is `DDlogRecord`,
which implements a self-describing representation of arbitrary DDlog values.  It
provides constructors to instantiate primitive DDlog types (e.g.,
`DDlogRecord(boolean b)` creates a value of type `bool`) and static methods to
inductively build more complex data structures by assembling records into
structs, tuples, vectors, and other container types (e.g., `public static
DDlogRecord makeTuple(DDlogRecord[] fields)` groups multiple values in a tuple).
It also provides methods to introspect DDlog values and extract their individual
fields.

The `DDlogRecord` class offers a program-independent way to work with DDlog
values, including values whose types are now known ahead of time.  At the same
time, it can be cumbersome to use, does not enforce type safety (e.g., one can
accidentally construct a record that does not match its type declaration), and
has suboptimal performance.

These limitations are addressed by the auto-generated API presented below.

### The `ddlog.<prog_name>` package

The `ddlog.<prog_name>` package, generated by the DDlog compiler when invoked
with the `-j` switch, offers a user-friendly way to read and write DDlog values.
It is specialized to a particular DDlog program and defines type-safe bindings
for DDlog types declared in this program, along with a convenience
`<prog_name>Relation` class that contains symbolic bindings for program relation
identifiers.

#### `class <prog_name>Relation`

A `DDlogCommand` instance contains a numeric identifier of an input or output
relation this command modifies, accessible with the `relid()` method:

```
int relid = command.relid();
```

The `ddlogapi.DDlogAPI` class provides a
program-independent way to map relation name to identifier via the `int
getTableId(String table)` method.  The auto-generated `<prog_name>Relation`
class provides a safer alternative by defining symbolic
constants for all program's input and output relations.  The following
snippet chooses an action to perform based on `relid` value:

```
switch (relid) {
    case redistRelation.Span: ...
    default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown relation id " + relid);
}
```

#### `class <prog_name>UpdateBuilder`

Internally, the `ddlog.<prog_name>` package works by serializing input updates
into a [FlatBuffer](https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/) and deserializing
changes received from DDlog via a FlatBuffer.  At the low level, this
functionality is backed by FlatBuffers-enabled C APIs.

The package exposes two sets of auto-generated classes responsible for
serializing and deserializing DDlog commands respectively.  The main class in
the serialization API is `<prog_name>UpdateBuilder`.  It supports the following
workflow:

1. Create an instance of `<prog_name>UpdateBuilder`:
    ```
    redistUpdateBuilder builder = new redistUpdateBuilder();
    ```

1. Use the builder to create one or more DDlog commands:
    ```
    builder.insert_DdlogNode(10000);
    builder.insert_DdlogBinding((short)100, 10000);
    builder.insert_DdlogDependency(10000, 20000);
    ```
    Here, the `insert_` prefix indicates that we are creating a command that
    inserts a record to a DDlog relation; the rest of the method name is the
    name of an input relation to insert the record to, e.g., `DdlogNode`.
    The number and types of arguments to each `insert_XXX` method match
    relation signature.

1. Call `applyUpdates()` method of the builder to push updates to the DDlog program:
    ```
    builder.applyUpdates(this.api);
    ```

1. Go back to step 1 to perform new updates.  Note that this requires creating a
   new builder instance for each new set of updates. 

Additional classes are generated to facilitate the construction of more complex
types.  For example, consider a relation that has a field whose type is a tuple:

```
typedef tuple = (bool, bit<8>, string)
input relation JI(a: (bool, bit<8>, string))
```

In order to insert to this relation, we must first construct a tuple object and
then use it to create a `JI` record:

```
Tuple3__bool__bit_8___stringWriter ji = builder.create_Tuple3__bool__bit_8___string(true, (byte)10, "string");
builder.insert_JI(ji);
```

The `Tuple3__bool__bit_8___stringWriter` class is generated by DDlog.  Similar
classes are generated for all complex DDlog types used in the program.

#### `class <prog_name>UpdateParser`

`<prog_name>UpdateParser` class is the dual of `<prog_name>UpdateBuilder` whose
job is to deserialize updates received from DDlog.  Its main method
`transactionCommitDumpChanges()` takes a `DDlogAPI` instance and a callback.  It
commits the current transaction invokes the callback for each output relation update
computed by DDlog.

```
redistUpdateParser.transactionCommitDumpChanges(
    this.api, r -> this.onCommit(r));
```

Here is an example callback:

```
void onCommit(DDlogCommand<Object> command) {
    int relid = command.relid();
    switch (relid) {
        case redistRelation.Span:
            SpanReader span = (SpanReader)command.value();
            System.out.println("From " + relid + " " + command.kind() + " Span{" + span.entity() + "," + span.tns() + "}");
            break;
        default: throw new IllegalArgumentException("Unknown relation id " + relid);
    }
}
```

The callback takes an argument of type `DDlogCommand<Object>`, where the
`Object` contains a DDlog record.  In order to access its fields,
we must downcast the value to the appropriate class for the relation it
belongs to. For example, if the record belongs to a relation named `Span`,
its actual type is `SpanReader`, which in turn provides methods to access
its fields.

#### `class <prog_name>Query`

The auto-generated `ddlog.<prog_name>.<prog_name>Query` class provides methods
to query [DDlog indexes](tutorial/tutorial.md#indexes).  There are two methods
for each index: the `query<index_name>` returns all values associated
with a given key, and the `dump<index_name>` returns all values in the indexed
relation.  For example, given a program called `graph.dl` with the following
declarations:

```
// graph.dl

relation Edge(from: bit<32>, to: bit<32>)
index Edge_by_from(from: bit<32>) on Edge(from, _)
```

DDlog generates `class graphQuery` as follows:

```
public class graphQuery
{
    public static void queryEdge_by_from(DDlogAPI hddlog, long from, Consumer<EdgeReader> callback) throws DDlogException
    {...}

    public static void dumpEdge_by_from(DDlogAPI hddlog, Consumer<EdgeReader> callback) throws DDlogException
    {...}
}
```

Both methods take a callback invoked once for each record returned by the query.
Both methods return *after* enumerating all records via the callback.

Here is a more exotic example:

```
input relation Rel(m: Option<bit<32>>)
index Rel_by_m(m: Option<bit<32>>) on Rel(m)
```

Here, the index has a comlpex key type (`Option<bit<32>>`).  Serializing this
type into a flatbuffer requires a FlatBuffer builder; therefore the generated
query method has a more complex signature:

```
public static void queryRel_by_m(DDlogAPI hddlog,
                                 Function<testFlatBufferBuilder, std_Option__bit_32_Writer> m,
                                 Consumer<TIReader> callback) throws DDlogException
```

Note how instead of supplying the value of `m`, the caller supplies a callback
that takes a `FlatBufferBuilder` instance and returns a handle to the serialized
representation of `m`.

#### DDlog-to-Java type mapping summary

Fields of primitive types, e.g., `bit<8>`, map directly to Java primitives;
complex types, like tuples and structs, map to their own `<type_name>Reader`
instances.  The following table summarizes the correspondence between
DDlog and Java types.

The following table summarizes Java types used in serialization and
deserialization APIs for each DDlog type.  In the table, `T_w` and `T_r` stands
for serialization and deserialization types of `T` that can be looked up in
the same table.
