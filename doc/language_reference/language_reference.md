# Datalog Language Reference

## Identifiers

Datalog is case-sensitive.  Relation, constructor, and type variable
names must start with upper-case ASCII letters; variable, function,
and argument names must start with lower-case ASCII letters or
underscore.  A type variable name must be prefixed with a tick (').
A type name can start with either an upper-case or a lower-case letter
or underscore.

```
    uc_identifier ::= [A..Z][a..zA..Z0..9_]*
    lc_identifier ::= [a..z_][a..zA..Z0..9_]*

    rel_name     ::= uc_identifier
    cons_name    ::= uc_identifier
    typevar_name ::= 'uc_identifier

    var_name     ::= lc_identifier
    field_name   ::= lc_identifier
    arg_name     ::= lc_identifier
    func_name    ::= lc_identifier

    type_name    ::= lc_identifier | uc_identifier
```

## Top-level declarations

A Datalog program is a list of type definitions, functions, relations, and rules.
The ordering of declarations does not matter, e.g., a type can be used
before being defined.

```EBNF
datalog ::= decl*

decl ::= typedef
       | function
       | relation
       | rule
```

### Constraints on top-level declarations
1. Type names must be globally unique
1. Function names must be globally unique
1. Relation names must be globally unique

## Types

Type definition introduces a new user-defined type, optionally
parameterized by one or more type arguments.  Type given without
definition is an *opaque* type implemented outside of the language.

```EBNF
typedef ::= "typedef" type_name (* unique type name *)
            ["<" typevar_name [("," typevar_name)*] ">"] (* optional type arguments *)
            ["=" type_spec] (* optional type definition *)
```

```EBNF
(* A full form of typespec. Used in typedef's only. *)
type_spec ::= int_type
            | bool_type
            | string_type
            | bitvector_type
            | tuple_type
            | union_type     (* tagged union *)
            | type_alias     (* reference to user-defined type *)
            | typevar_name   (* type variable *)

(* A restricted form of typespec that does not declare new tagged
    unions (and hence does not introduce new constructor names to
    the namespace.  Used in argument, field, variable declarations. *)
simple_type_spec ::= int_type
                   | bool_type
                   | string_type
                   | bitvector_type
                   | tuple_type
                   | type_alias
                   | typevar_name
```

```EBNF
int_type         ::= "int" (* unbounded mathematical integer *)
bool_type        ::= "bool"
string_type      ::= "string" (* UTF-8 string *)
bitvector_type   ::= "bit" "<" decimal ">"
tuple_type       ::= "(" simple_type_spec* ")"
union_type       ::= (constructor "|")* constructor
type_alias       ::= type_name           (* type name declared using typedef*)
                     ["<" type_spec [("," type_spec)*] ">"] (* type arguments *)

constructor      ::= cons_name (* constructor without fields *)
                   | cons_name "{" [field ("," field)*] "}"
field            ::= field_name ":" simple_type_spec
```

### Constraints on types
1. Type argument names must be unique within a typedef, e.g.,
`typedef t1<'A,'A,'B>` is invalid.
1. All type arguments of a `typedef` must be used in the type definition:
    ```
    // error: type argument 'D not used in type definition
    typedef Parameterized<'A,'B,'C,'D> = Option1{x: 'A}
                                       | Option2{y: 'B, z: 'C}
    ```
1. The number of bits in a bitvector type must be greater than 0, e.g.,
`bit<0>` is invalid.
1. Type constructor names must be globally unique.
1. If multiple type constructors for the same type have arguments with
identical names, their types must be identical, e.g., the following is invalid:
    ```
    typedef type1 = Constr1{field1: string, field2: bool} | Constr2{field1: int}
    ```
1. A type must be instantiated with the number of type
arguments matching its declaration:
    ```
    typedef type1<'A,'B>
    function f(): bool = {
        var x: type1<int> // error: not enough type arguments
    }
    ```
1. Recursive type definitions are not allowed.
1. A type variable must be declared in the syntactic scope where it is
   used.  There are two types of syntactic scopes that can contain
   type variables: `typedef`'s and functions.  In a typedef, type
   variables are declared using angle brackets following type name.
   These variables can be referred in the type expression to the right
   of "=":
   ```
   typedef type2<'A,'B> = Cons1{field1: 'A, field2: type2<'B>}
                  |                      |                 |
                  |                       \---used here---/
                  \- type variables declared here
   ```
   
   In a function declaration, type variables are declared implicitly
   by referring to them in function arguments.  They are used in the
   return type of the function and in its body:
   ```
   function f(arg1: 'A, arg2: type2<'A,'B>): 'A = {
       var x: 'A = arg1;
       x
   }
   ```
   Examples of invalid use of type variables in functions:
   ```
   function f(arg: 'A): 'B = /*error: type variable 'B is not defined here*/
   {
       var x: 'C; /* error: type variable 'C is not defined here */
   }
   ```
1. Rules and relations are defined over concrete types and cannot
   refer to type variables.

## Functions

Functions are pure (side-effect-free computations).  A function can have 
optional definition.  A function without definition refers to a
foreign function implemented outside of Datalog.

```EBNF
function ::= "function" func_name "(" [arg(,arg)*]")"
              ":" simple_type_spec (* return type *)
              ["=" expr]    (* optional function definition *)
```

```EBNF
arg ::= arg_name ":" simple_type_spec
```


### Constraints on functions

1. The body of the function must be a valid expression whose type
   matches the return type of the function.
1. Recursive functions are not allowed.

## Relations

```EBNF
relation ::= ["ground"] "relation" rel_name "(" [arg ","] arg ")"
```

### Constraints of relations
1. Column names must be unique within a relation
1. Column types cannot use type variables

## Expressions

```EBNF
expr ::= term
       | expr "["decimal "," decimal"]"  (*bit slice (e[h:l])*)
       | expr ":" simple_type_spec       (*explicit type signature*)
       | expr "." identifier             (*struct field*)
       | "~" expr                        (*bitwise negation*)
       | "not" expr                      (*boolean negation*)
       | "(" expr ")"                    (*grouping*)
       | "{" expr "}"                    (*grouping (alternative syntax)*)
       | expr "*" expr                   (* multiplication *)
       | expr "/" expr                   (* division *)
       | expr "%" expr                   (*remainder*)
       | expr "+" expr
       | expr "-" expr
       | expr ">>" expr                  (*right shift*)
       | expr "<<" expr                  (*left shift*)
       | expr "++" expr                  (*bitvector concatenation*)
       | expr "==" expr
       | expr "!=" expr
       | expr ">" expr
       | expr ">=" expr
       | expr "<" expr
       | expr "<=" expr
       | expr "&" expr                   (*bitwise and*)
       | expr "|" expr                   (*bitwise or*)
       | expr "and" expr                 (*logical and*)
       | expr "or" expr                  (*logical or*)
       | expr "=>" expr                  (*implication*)
       | expr "=" expr                   (*assignment*)
       | expr ";" expr                   (*sequential composition*)
```

The following table lists operators order by decreasing priority.

|**priority** | **operators**       |
| ------ |:-----------------------:|
| Highest| e[h:l], x:t, x.f        |
|        | ~                       |
|        | not                     |
|        | %  / *                  |
|        | +, -                    |
|        | <<, >>                  |
|        | ++                      |
|        | ==, !=, < , <=, >, >=   |
|        | &                       |
|        | &#124;                  |
|        | and                     |
|        | or                      |
|        | =>                      |
|        | =                       |
| Lowest | ;                       |

```EBNF
term ::= "_"               (* wildcard *)
       | int_literal       (* integer literal *)
       | bool_literal      (* Boolean literal *)
       | string_literal    (* string literal *)
       | cons_term         (* type constructor invocation *)

       | ite_term          (* if-then-else term *)
       | vardecl_term      (* local variable declaration *)
```

**Integer literal syntax is currently arcane and will be changed to
C-style syntax.**

```EBNF
int_literal  ::= decimal
               | [width] "'d" decimal
               | [width] "'h" hexadecimal
               | [width] "'o" octal
               | [width] "'b" binary
width ::= decimal
```

**We rely on parsec's standard parser for strings, which
supports unicode and escaping. TODO: check and document its exact
functionality.**

```EBNF
string_literal   ::= '"' UTF-8 string with escaping '"' 
```

                 cons_name ["{" [expr (,expr)*] "}"]
                 (* named arguments *)
               | cons_name ["{" "." field_name "=" expr 
                            ("," "." field_name "=" expr)* "}"]

          | var_term        (* binds variable to a field inside the matched value

          | bool_literal    (* matches specified bool value *)
          | string_literal  (* matches specified string value *)
          | int_literal     (* matches specified integer or bitvector value *)
          | "_"             (* wildcard, matches any value *)
```

### Constraints on expressions

1. Number and types of arguments to a function must match function
   declaration.  
1. Variable declarations can occur in the left-hand side of an
   assignment or as a separate statement followed by another
   statement.  In the latter case variable type must be explicitly 
   specified:
   ```
   typedef C = C{x: string}
   typedef TwoFields = TwoFields{f1: string, f2: string}
   ...

   // ok: type of x specified explicitly
   var x: int; 

   // error: variable declared without a type
   var x;

   // ok: the type of y is derived from the right-hand side 
   // of the assignment
   var y = C{.x = "foo"};

   // ok: no harm in specifying type explicitly even if it could
   // be inferred automatically.
   var z: C = C{.x = "bar"};

   // ok: assigning multiple variables simultaneously
   (var a, var b) = (x+5, x-5);
   C{var c} = y;

   // ok 
   var t = TwoFields{.f1 = "foo", .f2 = "bar"};

   // ok: field f2 omitted in the left-hand side of an assignment
   TwoFields{.f1 = var g} = t;

   // error: field f2 omitted in the right-hand side of an assignment
   var h = TwoFields{.f1 = "foo"}
   ```
1. A variable declaration cannot shadow existing variables visible
   in the local scope.  Variables visible inside the body of a function 
   include: function arguments, local variables declared using `var`, and 
   variables introduced through `match` patterns:
   ```
   var i: bit<32> = match (a) {
       C0{.x = v} -> v, // variable v bound inside match pattern
       C1{v} -> v       // variable v bound inside match pattern
   };

   function shadow(a: string): () = {
       var v: string;
       var v = "foo"; // error: variable re-definition
       var a = "bar"  // error: variable shadows argument name
   }
   ```
   Variables in rules are discussed below.
1. *Guarded fields* of tagged unions cannot be accessed using '.field'
   syntax.  A guarded field is a field that is present in some but not
   all of the type constructors, e.g., `value` in the `option_t` type 
   ```
   typedef option_t<'A> = None
                        | Some {value : 'A}
   ```
   Accessing such a field has undefined outcome when the field is not
   present:
   ```
   var a: Some<string>;
   var b = a.value // error: access to guarded field value
   ```
   Use pattern matching instead, e.g.:
   ```
   var b = match (a) {
       Some{v} -> v,
       None    -> ""
   }
   ```
1. Patterns in a `match` expression must be exhaustive.

## Rules

A Datalog rule consists of one or more left-hand-side atoms (multiple 
LHS atoms are used to abbreviate rules with identical right-hand 
sides), zero or more . 

```EBNF
rule ::= atom (,atom)* ":-" atom' (,atom')*

atom ::= rel_name "(" expr (,expr)* ")"
       | rel_name "(" "." arg_name "=" expr [("," "." arg_name "=" expr)*] ")"

atom' ::= atom                                      (* 1.atom *)
        | "not" atom                                (* 2.negated atom *)
        | expr                                      (* 3.condition *)
        | expr "=" expr                             (* 4.condition *)
        | "FlatMap" "(" var_name "=" expr ")"       (* 5.flat map *)
        | "Aggregate" "("                           (* 6.aggregation *)
          "(" [var_name ("," var_name)*] ")" "," 
          var_name "=" expr ")"
```

We briefly discuss each form of right-hand-side clause (`atom'`). The
first two forms (`atom` and `"not" atom`) represent a *literal*, i.e.,
an atomic predicate or its negation:

```
Cousins(x,y) :- Parent(z,x),
                Parent(q,y),
                Siblings(z,q),
                not Siblings(x,y)
```

The third form is a Boolean expression over variables introduced in the 
RHS of the rule. It filters the result of the query.

```
Siblings(x,y) :- Parent(z,x), Parent(z,y), x != y
```

The fourth form is an assignment expression that may introduce new
variables as well as filter the query by pattern matching, e.g.,:

```
DHCP_Options_server_ip(opts, ipv6_string_mapped(in6_generate_lla(mac))) :-
    DHCP_Options_options(opts, "server_id", val),
    NoIP4Addr = ip_parse(val),
    SomeMAC{mac} = eth_addr_from_string(val)
```

Here we first filter the relation, only keeping records where
`ip_parse(val) == NoIP4Addr`. Next we extract Ethernet address from 
`val` and bind the result to new variable `mac`, while filtering out 
those values that do not parse to a valid Ethernet address.

The fifth form is a flat map operation, which expands each record in
the relation computed so far to a set of records, computes a union of 
all sets and binds a record in the resulting relation to a fresh
variable, e.g.:

```
Logical_Switch_Port_ips(lsp, mac, ip) :-
    Logical_Switch_Port_addresses(lsp, addrs),
    (mac, ips) = extract_mac(addrs),
    FlatMap(ip = extract_ips(ips))
```

Here, `extract_ips` must return a *set* of IP addresses.

The sixth form groups records computed so far by a subset of fields,
computes an aggreagate for each group using specified aggregate function 
(*requirements on aggregate function signature to be specified*), and
binds the result to a new variable:

```
ShortestPath(x,y, c) :- Path(x,y,cost), Aggregate((x,y), c = min(cost))
```

# FTL syntax

FTL is an imperative language for expressing datalog relations, with a syntax based on FLWOR
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLWOR.

```
rule ::= forStatement

forStatement ::= "for" "(" expr "in" rel_name ")" statement
             | "for" "(" expr "in" rel_name "if" expression ")" statement           

statement ::= forStatement
          | ifStatement
          | letStatement
          | insertStatement
          | blockStatement
          | emptyStatement
          
ifStatement ::= "if" "(" expression ")" statement
             
letStatement ::= "let" identifier "=" expression (, identifier "=" expression )* in" statement

insertStatement ::= "insert" rel_name "," expression

blockStatement ::= "{" statement ( ";" statement )* "}"

emptyStatement ::= "skip"            
```
