\section{Conclusion and future work}\label{sec-conclusions}

DDlog is a young project.  The language is evolving quickly, driven by
the use cases.  We place paramount importance on language usability;
this is why we have enhanced Datalog with many non-traditional
constructs.  Our goal is to reduce as much as possible the need to
transition between multiple languages when writing large projects.

Our ongoing work on DDlog focuses on continuous improvement of its
performance and memory utilization, as well as use-case-driven evolution
of its syntax, features, and libraries.
