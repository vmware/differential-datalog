# Go bindings for the DDlog API

We provide a Go module with a single `ddlog` package which defines wrappers
around the DDlog C API.

Building this package requires access to the ddlog.h header file along with the
dynamic library generated by DDlog for your program. We use
[cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) to invoke the DDlog C API and we expect the
following environment variables to be set at build time:
 * `CGO_CPPFLAGS` must be set so that the directory including ddlog.h is added
 to the C compiler's search path.
 * `CGO_LDFLAGS` must be set so that the linker searches the dynamic library
 generated for your program.

For an example, refer to [cmd/example/](cmd/example], which is a Go program
using the DDlog Go bindings. This program assumes that the DDlog program
[typesTest.dl](/test/types_test/typesTest.dl) is the one being used. The example
can be built and run with `./run-example.sh`. Refer to this script to understand
how to set `CGO_CPPFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS`.

## Running the tests

If you make changes to the `ddlog` Go package, you can validate your changes by
running the unit tests with `./run-tests.sh`.
