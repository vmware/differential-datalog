 * `workers` is the number of DDlog worker threads that will be
 * allocated to run the program.  While any positive integer value is
 * valid, values larger than the number of cores in the system are
 * likely to hurt the performance.
 *
 * `do_store` - set to true to store the copy of output tables inside DDlog.
 * When set, the client can use the following APIs to retrieve the contents of
 * tables:
 *	- `ddlog_dump_ovsdb_delta()`
 *	- `ddlog_dump_table()`
 * This has a cost in terms of memory and CPU.  In addition, the current implementation
 * serializes all writes to its internal copies of tables, introducing contention
 * when `workers > 1`.  Therefore, this flag should be set to `false` if the
 * client prefers to use DDlog in streaming mode, via the callback mechanism
 * (see below).
 *
 * `cb` - callback to be invoked for every record added to or removed from an
 * output relation.  DDlog guarantees that the callback can only be invoked in
 * two situations: (1) from the `ddlog_run()` function, as the DDlog program
 * is initialized with static records (if any), (2) from
 * `ddlog_transaction_commit()`, as DDlog applies updates performed by the
 * transaction.
 *   The `cb` function takes the following arguments:
 *	- `arg`	     - opaque used-defined value
 *	- `table`    - table being modified
 *	- `rec`	     - record that has been inserted or deleted
 *	- `polarity` - `true` - record has been added
 *		       `false` - record has been deleted
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Thread safety: DDlog invokes the callback from its worker threads
 * without any serialization to avoid contention. Hence, if the `workers` argument
 * is greater than 1, then `cb` must be prepared to handle concurrent invocations
 * from multiple threads.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: DDlog does not guarantee that callback is invoked at most once for
 * each record and for each transaction.  Depending on your specific dataflow,
 * it is possible that DDlog will, e.g., create and then delete a record within a
 * transaction, and invoke `cb` both times.
 *
 * Setting `cb` to NULL disables notifications.
 *
 * `print_err_msg` - callback to redirect diagnostic messages to.  Before
 * returning an error, functions in this API invoke this callback to print
 * error explanation.
 *
 * Setting `print_err_msg` to NULL causes ddlog to print to `stderr`.
 *
 * Returns a program handle to be used in subsequent calls to
 * `ddlog_transaction_start()`,
 * `ddlog_transaction_commit()`, etc., or NULL in case of error.

 * Record API
 ***********************************************************************/

/*
 * The record API is intended solely for passing values to and from
 * DDlog.  It allows constructing and reading values, but does not
 * provide methods to otherwise manipulate them, e.g., to lookup an
 * element in a set or map.
 *
 * This API supports the following ownership policy (see additional
 * details in individual function description):
 *
 * - The client obtains ownership of a record by creating it using
 *   `ddlog_bool()`, `ddlog_string()`, `ddlog_tuple()`, etc.  This is
 *   currently the only way to obtain ownership.
 *
 * - The client yields ownership by either passing the record to DDlog
 *   as part of an update command (see `ddlog_apply_updates()`) or by
 *   attaching it to another owned object (e.g., appending it to a
 *   vector using `ddlog_vector_push()`).
 *
 * - Each owned record encapsulates some dynamically allocated memory.
 *   To avoid memory leaks, the client must transfer the ownership of
 *   every record they own or deallocate the record using
 *   `ddlog_free()`.
 *
 * - There is a limited API for modifying _owned_ records, e.g., by
 *   appending elements to an array.
 *
 * - In addition to owned records, the client can also obtain pointers to
 *   *borrowed* records in one of two ways:
 *
 *    1. By invoking the `ddlog_dump_table()` function to enumerate the
 *       content of an output table.  This function takes a user callback
 *       and invokes it once for each record in the table.  The record,
 *       passed as argument to the callback is owned by DDlog and is only
 *       valid for the duration of the callback.
 *       (TODO: the only reason for this is convenience, so the client
 *       does not need to worry about deallocating the record later.
 *       The API could be changed to return owned records.)
 *
 *    2. By querying another record of type tuple, vector, set or map.
 *       For instance, `ddlog_get_vector_elem()` returns a borrowed
 *       reference to an element of the vector.
 *
 * - The client may inspect a borrowed record, but not modify it, attach
 *   to another records or pass to DDlog as part of an update.
 *
 * - Owned records are represented in the API by mutable pointers
 *   (`ddlog_record*`), whereas borrowed records are represented by
 *   immutable pointers (`const ddlog_record*`).
 *
 * Type checking:
 *
 * The Record API does not perform any type checking, e.g., one can
 * create a vector with elements of different types or a struct whose
 * fields don't match declarations in the DDlog program. Type checking
 * is performed by DDlog before inserting records to the database, e.g.,
 * in the `ddlog_apply_updates()` function.  The function will fail if
 * it detects type mismatch between relation type and the record
 * supplied by the client.
 *
 * The client can rely on records read from the database to have types
 * that matches the corresponding DDlog output table declaration.
