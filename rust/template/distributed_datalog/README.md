Distributed Differential-Datalog
----------------------------------------
This crate contains most of the functionality comprising **Distributed
Differential-Datalog** (**D3log**). As the name suggests, **D3log** is
an effort to connect multiple `differential-datalog` programs in a
sensible way and distribute their computation among multiple compute
nodes.

### *Note:*
----------------------------------------------------------------------
> **D3log** is a work in progress with the API surface constantly
> evolving and changing. No backwards compatibility is provided.

### Organization/Structure
**D3log** is being developed against and made accessible via the Rust
APIs of a `ddlog` project, with all the code residing below
[`rust/template/`][rust-template]. The current design is based on a
variation of the observer pattern as employed and described by
[ReactiveX][reactivex.io], with a program running on one node (an
"observer) subscribing to (i.e., observing) the changes produced by
another (an "observable").

**D3log** is being built bottom up, starting with the individual
building blocks we envision to use in the future in a well tested form.
As it stands that means we have the following components:
- the `Observable`-`Observer` core-infrastructure itself, residing in
  the [`observe`][observe] module
- a `DDlogServer` (residing in [`server.rs`][server.rs] that wraps a
  standard `HDDlog` and adapts it to the `Observer` interface
  - such an object can also stream changes produced by certain (output)
    relations and these changes can be subscribed to (i.e., such a
    stream is an instance of an `Observable`)
- a TCP channel (contained in the [`tcp_channel`][tcp_channel] module)
  comprised of a `TcpSender` (an `Observer`) and a `TcpReceiver` (an
  `Observable`) that can connect two `ddlog` programs (wrapped in
  `DDlogServer` objects) and transfer deltas produced
- a transaction multiplexer (`TxnMux`) that allows for serializing
  transactions as emitted by multiple `Observables` such that no two
  transactions interleave
- [sources][sources] and [sinks][sinks] that produce and consume
  updates, respectively, and can be fit into the system using the
  `Observable` and `Observer` interfaces

### Examples & Tests
**D3log** has unit as well as integration style tests using an actual
`ddlog` program that serve both as tests and examples on how to use the
APIs. Unit tests reside along with the individual components/module and
integration tests are located in the [`server_api`][server_api] program.
