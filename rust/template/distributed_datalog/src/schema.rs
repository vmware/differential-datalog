//! Schema definitions for d3log. Most of this data is to be stored in
//! serialized form on some entity accessible from all nodes in the
//! system.
//!
//! As a general note: we use BTree based maps & sets here over hashing
//! based ones for two reasons:
//! - they guarantee a stable order of elements which makes our
//!   resulting computation predictable (node assignment based on data
//!   in a hash map could yield different results on different nodes due
//!   to randomness induced into the hashing part on purpose)
//! - BTree based data structures can be nested nicely because `Ord` and
//!   `PartialOrd` are defined for `BTreeMap` & `BTreeSet`, whereas hash
//!   based ones need custom `Hash` definitions
//!
//! We have the following components:
//! - Membership:
//!   Nodes participating in the distributed computation are represented
//!   by the `Member` struct.
//! - Configuration:
//!   From top to bottom we have a configuration describing the desired
//!   state of the system, `SysCfg`. This state is essentially a
//!   description of the required compute node configurations.
//!   Each compute node configuration (`NodeCfg`) is comprised of a map
//!   from relation IDs (the relations "belonging" to this node) to a
//!   set of relation configurations, `RelCfg`. It's a set because a
//!   relation can have multiple purposes. A relation configuration in
//!   turn describes one property of the relation: it could have a set
//!   of input relations and/or be fed directly from a source.
//!
//! # Important:
//!
//! We currently assume globally unique relation IDs, which also means
//! we require the exact same program to be present on all nodes in the
//! system. This is a simplifying assumption made for the time being.
//! Ideally, a relation ID really would be a `(Node, RelId)` tuple (or
//! something along those lines).
