# Differential Datalog (DDlog)

DDlog is a *bottom-up*, *incremental*, *in-memory*, *typed* Datalog engine. It is well suited for
writing programs that incrementally update their output in response to input changes. With DDlog,
the programmer does not need to worry about writing incremental algorithms.
Instead they specify the desired input-output mapping in a declarative manner, using a dialect of Datalog.
The DDlog compiler then synthesizes an efficient incremental implementation.
DDlog is based on [Frank McSherry's](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/)
excellent [differential dataflow](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/differential-dataflow) library.

1. **Bottom-up**: DDlog starts from a set of *ground facts* (i.e., facts provided by the user) and
computes *all* possible derived facts by following Datalog rules, in a bottom-up fashion.  In
contrast, top-down engines are optimized to answer individual user queries without computing all
possible facts ahead of time.  For example, given a Datalog program that computes pairs of connected
vertices in a graph, a bottom-up engine maintains the set of all such pairs.  A top-down engine, on
the other hand, is triggered by a user query to determine whether a pair of vertices is connected
and handles the query by searching for a derivation chain back to ground facts.  The bottom-up
approach is preferable in applications where all derived facts must be computed ahead of time and in
applications where the cost of initial computation is amortized across a large number of queries.

2. **Incremental**: whenever the set of ground facts changes, DDlog only performs the minimum computation
necessary to compute all changes in the derived facts.  This has significant performance benefits for many queries.

3. **In-memory**: DDlog stores and processes data in memory.  In a typical use case, a DDlog program
is used in conjunction with a persistent database, with database records being fed to DDlog as
ground facts and the derived facts computed by DDlog being written back to the database.

    At the moment, DDlog can only operate on databases that completely fit the memory of a single
    machine. (This may change in the future, as DDlog builds on the differential dataflow library that
    supports distributed computation over partitioned data).

4. **Typed**: Although Datalog is a programming language, in its classical textbook form it
is more of a mathematical formalism than a practical tool for programmers.  In particular, pure
Datalog does not have concepts like data types, arithmetics, strings or functions.  To facilitate
writing of safe, clear, and concise code, DDlog extends pure Datalog with:

    1. A powerful type system, including Booleans, unlimited precision integers, bitvectors, strings,
    tuples, tagged unions, vectors, sets, and maps.

    2. Standard integer and bitvector arithmetic.

    3. A simple procedural language that allows expressing many computations natively in DDlog without
resorting to external functions.

    4. String operations, including string concatenation and interpolation.

    5. Syntactic sugar for writing imperative-style code using for/let/assignments.

5. **Integrated**: while DDlog programs can be run interactively via a command line interface, its
primary use case is to integrate with other applications that require deductive database
functionality.  A DDlog program is compiled into a Rust library that can be linked against a Rust,
C/C++ or Java program (bindings for other languages can be easily added).  This enables good performance,
but somewhat limits the flexibility, as
changes to the relational schema or rules require re-compilation.

## Installing from sources

### Prerequisites
We have tested our software on Ubuntu Linux and MacOS.

The compilers are written in Haskell.  One needs the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler.  The Haskell compiler is managed by the
[stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack) tool.
To download stack (if you don't already have it) use:

```
wget -qO- https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh
```

You will also need to install the Rust toolchain v1.34 or later:

```
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```

**Note:** The `rustup` script adds path to Rust toolchain binaries (typically, `$HOME/.cargo/bin`)
to `~/.profile`, so that it becomes effective at the next login attempt.  To configure your current
shell run `source $HOME/.cargo/env`.

Finally, you will need static versions of the following libraries: `libpthread.a`, `libc.a`, `libm.a`, `librt.a`, `libutil.a`, `libdl.a`, `libgmp.a`, which can be installed from distro-specific packages.

If you plan to use DDlog Java bindings, you will additionally need the Google
FlatBuffers library.  Download and build FlatBuffers release 1.11.0 from
[github](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases/tag/v1.11.0).  Make sure
that the `flatc` tool is in your `$PATH`.  Additionally, make sure that FlatBuffers
Java classes are in your `$CLASSPATH`.

### Building

To build the software:

```
git clone https://github.com/ryzhyk/differential-datalog.git
cd differential-datalog
stack build
```

To install DDlog binaries in Haskell stack's default binary directory:

```
stack install
```

To install to a different location:

```
stack install --local-bin-path <custom_path>
```

To run the tests execute (**Note:** this takes a while (~30 minutes on my system) and requires ~20GB
of disk space):

```
stack test
```

## Binary installation

To install a precompiled version of DDlog, download the [latest binary release](https://github.com/ryzhyk/differential-datalog/releases), extract it from archive and add `ddlog/bin` to your `$PATH`. You will also need to install the Rust toolchain (see instructions [above](#prerequisites))

## vim syntax highlighting

Create a symlink to `tools/dl.vim` from the `~/.vim/syntax/` directory to enable differential
datalog syntax highlighting in `.dl` files.

## Debugging with GHCi

To run the test suite with the GHCi debugger:

```
stack ghci --ghci-options -isrc --ghci-options -itest differential-datalog:differential-datalog-test
```

and type `do main` in the command prompt.

## Building with profiling info enabled

```
stack clean
```

followed by

```
stack build --profile
```

or

```
stack test --profile
```
